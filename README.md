# Enhanced NYT Connections Game

This project a clone of the [popular "Connections" game](https://www.nytimes.com/games/connections) featured in the New York Times. The game challenges players to find connections between seemingly unrelated words through a series of associations.

I have also added an option for users to create, save, and share their own versions of the game.

## Overview

Connections is a web-based game designed to entertain and stimulate players' minds by presenting them with word associations to decipher. Players are given a set of words and must find the common thread that links them together.

## Features

Responsive design: ensure a seamless experience across desktop and mobile platforms.

Modal dialogues: allow the player to access the settings, instructions on how to play, and viewing game play results.

### In Development

Enable users to create their own connections and share its link to their friends.

Backend that serves up new puzzle prompts each day.
